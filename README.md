# Android Question Game

## Course Assignment Project

This Android application was developed as a course assignment for mobile application development. It's a math quiz game designed to help users practice their arithmetic skills through interactive questions with different difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from three different difficulty levels with varying time constraints:
  - Level 0: No time limit for practicing at your own pace
  - Level 1: 20 seconds per question for moderate challenge
  - Level 2: 10 seconds per question for advanced users

- **Beautiful UI**: Modern interface with custom background images for each game screen

- **Progress Tracking**: Track your progress with question counters and timers

- **Detailed Results**: Get comprehensive feedback after completing 10 questions, including:
  - Score out of 10
  - Percentage score with visual indicator
  - Color-coded performance feedback

- **Social Sharing**: Share your results with friends

## How It Works

1. The app starts with a splash screen
2. The home screen allows you to select your preferred difficulty level
3. Answer 10 math questions within the time limit (if applicable)
4. View your detailed results with performance analysis
5. Play again or return to the home screen

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Background Management**: Custom background handling system
